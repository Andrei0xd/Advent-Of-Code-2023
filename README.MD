# Advent of Code 2023

- This is just for fun, not competing nor really trying to optimize.

- Usually just commiting the first working solution, unless I find any of the problems fun to think deeper about.

- If I don't have much time I'll quickly solve it in python, but if I have some free time on my hands will probably try to code them in Go since I'm learning it on the side.
